# Network_dynamics
This file contains the code for violin plot visulaization of partitions created on a network.
The partitions are created on a artificial network of size 1000 generated from a benchmark.
The a parttiton algorithm is applied on the network, which generates the communties with different values of threshold.
These community sizes are stored in a excel file which are then visualized as violin plots.
